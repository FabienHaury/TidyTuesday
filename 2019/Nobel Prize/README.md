## Introduction and Problem Statement  
The world of data is an ever-growing field. Covering the full spectrum from gathering and cleaning data to analysis, one aspect is often overlooked: data visualization.  
All the work done to make data meaningful can be lost if the way it is communicated makes it hard to understand.  
That is why this week focuses on improving skills in data visualization and learning how to make graphics that not only look good but also help answer questions more clearly.

## Methodologies  
As mentioned, the purpose of this week is not to dive deeply into answering questions but to focus on creating effective graphics.  
Therefore, the *Methodologies* section will be developed in the [Visualization](#visualization) part and will explain the thought process behind creating the different graphics.

## Visualization

- The main idea is to show the number of men and women who have won a Nobel Prize.  
  - Points mark the number of prizes won by men and women each year, while connections between them highlight the yearly difference.  
  - This revealed an immediate challenge: not every year had a female laureate, meaning some years lacked comparative data.  
    To preserve continuity in the chart, years without female winners are assigned a value of zero.  
    - *Note:* This approach introduces some visual clutter, so care was taken to balance clarity and information density.  
- Breaking the axis — or not starting them at zero — clarifies that the two axes use different scales and serve different purposes.  
- Highlighting three key historical periods helps contextualize the data:  
  - The two World Wars illustrate an important contrast: during WWI, prizes were still awarded, while WWII caused a three-year gap.  
  - The year when a new Nobel category was introduced was also marked as a reference point.  
- Finally, a title and subtitle guide readers toward the graphic’s main message:  
  - **Title:**  
     - *A century-long* indicates the time span of the dataset.  
     - *Dive* suggests that the graphic reads vertically (top to bottom) and plays as a small pun.  
     - The subject, ***Nobel Prizes***, is clearly stated.  
  - **Subtitle:**  
     - It describes what is being shown — the number of Nobel Prize winners.  
     - Instead of a legend, the words ***men*** and ***women*** appear in their respective line colors.
