## Introduction and Problem Statement

The world of data is an ever-growing field. Covering the full spectrum from gathering and cleaning data to analysis, one aspect is often overlooked: **data visualization**.  
Even the most thorough analysis can lose its impact if the results are not communicated clearly.  

This project aims to strengthen my data visualization skills by creating visuals that are not only aesthetically appealing but also enhance understanding and deliver clearer insights.

## Methodologies

The main goal of this project is not to answer a specific research question but to **develop effective and insightful graphics**.  
The *Methodologies* section will be expanded in the [Visualization](#visualization) part, describing the reasoning and design choices behind each visualization.
### Explanation of green VS non-green energy.  
**Green energy** means very low CO₂ and useful for climate goals, wind, solar, nuclear, hydro and geothermal are considered *green* for this project.   
**Non-green energy** means high CO₂ emissions or other pollution and works against climate goals.
