# TidyTuesday

</div>


Welcome to my **TidyTuesday** repository! This project is inspired by the [#TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) initiative from the R4DS community. Each week, I practice manipulating, visualizing, and analyzing various datasets, primarily using **R** and the **tidyverse** packages.

## What is TidyTuesday?

**TidyTuesday** is a community project that releases a new dataset to explore every week. The goal is to practice:

- Cleaning and transforming data with **dplyr**, **tidyr**, etc.
- Creating impactful visualizations with **ggplot2**
- Sharing analyses and code with the community

## Repository Structure

Each folder corresponds to a week and contains:

- The R (or Python) script used for the analysis
- The generated visualizations
- A brief summary of insights drawn from the data

## How to Participate?

1. **Download** the dataset of the week from the [official repository](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday).
2. **Explore** the data and create your own visualizations.
3. **Share** your results on social media using the hashtag **#TidyTuesday**.

## Example Visualizations

Here are some of my favorite analyses: *(Under construction â€“ more content coming soon!)*
