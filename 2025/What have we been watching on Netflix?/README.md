## Methodologies
Key columns used include:
- **report**: Report period, always six months starting from January
- **title**: Title of the movie or show
- **available_globally?**: Whether the movie or show is available globally
- **hours_viewed**: Overall total hours spent watching
- **views**: Number of views
- **runtime**: Duration of the movie or show. For shows, this represents the total duration of the series, not an individual episode.

### Data Processing
- Cleaning the **available_globally?** column, as some lines incorrectly contain the value `'available_globally?'`
- Converting **runtime** (e.g., "2h 15m") into **runtime_minutes** (e.g., 135 minutes) for easier analysis
- Creating a **runtime_category** column to categorize titles by duration, allowing for better insights
- Removing show titles from the movies dataset using keyword searches for "Season," "Series," and "Limited Series"
