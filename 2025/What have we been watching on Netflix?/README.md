- **hours_viewed**: Overall total hours spend watching
- **views**: Numbers of views
- **runtime**: Duration of the movie or show. For show it represent the total duration of the show, not of an episode

Data processing includes: 
- Cleaning of **available_globally?** as somes lines contains the value 'available_globally?'
- Converting **runtime** into **runtime_minutes**, a more suitable format for use
- Using the new **runtime_minutes** column for creating **runtime_category** that categorise title by duration into different categories with the intend of allowing better insights
- Removing some **title** in the movies dataset who are show, using a simple search on thoses keywords: "Season", "Series", "Limited Series"
