## Introduction and Problematic  
Why study the *Number Ones* of Billboard?  
1. **Commercial success indicator**  
   The *Billboard Hot 100* chart is a barometer of commercial success.  
   Analyzing *Number Ones* shows which artists, genres, or labels dominate during a given period.  
2. **Sociological and generational study**  
   Songs reaching the top reveal recurring themes (love, protest, party, etc.) and mirror societal concerns (crises, social movements, technological innovations).  
3. **Analysis of marketing and industry strategies**  
   Reaching Billboard #1 is often the result of promotion strategies (radio airplay, marketing campaigns, streaming, sales).  
   It's an excellent case study to understand the music industry and its mechanics.  
And many more reasons!

#### Key takeaways:  
1. **Incomplete decades (1950 and 2020)**  
   The *Billboard Hot 100* only exists since **1958** → few data for the 1950s.  
   The 2020 decade is ongoing → partial analysis.  
2. **Two peaks of high critical ratings**  
   - **1960-1970**: golden age of pop/rock (Beatles, Motown, protest).  
   - **2000-2010**: rise of R&B, hip hop, global pop → ratings above 6.  
3. **Average song duration**  
   - Continuous rise until the **1990s** (CD era).  
   - Structural drop since **streaming** (2000-2020) → shorter songs to prevent skips.  
4. **BPM evolution**  
   Overall stable BPM, but acceleration since **2010** → dance/EDM/reggaeton influence.
